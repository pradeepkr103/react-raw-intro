## Responsive mobile first vs Native Mobile

TODO

* Responsive mobile First for Enterprise SaaS - does it work?
	- Reality is Javascript and Mobile have advanced a lot
	- For Enterprises the mobile fragmentation is really hard to manage


* Why not Ruby-on-Rails ActiveRecord, MVC and Migrations?
	- Ruby on Rails and similar MVC frameworks in Python, Scala or Java are all good. However the problem is the tech stack becomes very think and hard to comprehend.


* Native Mobile?
	- TODO
