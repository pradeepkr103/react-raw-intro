## Intro - Learning React with a minimal (tool) chains

This is a series of examples for a basic intro to React.js using plain old javascript and no toolchain.
This is achieved by simply including lib/react-with-addons.js and lib/JSXTransformer.js.

I believe that it is better to develop using your own IDE and using in-browser development tools (eg chrome ) so you can learn to troubleshoot typos and debug efficiently.

This repo has examples of increasing difficulty that don't require any build tools. 
Next step is to see the (future todo) react-webpack-redux for examples using full toolchain.
