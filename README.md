## Intro - Learning React with a minimal (tool) chains

This is a series of examples for a basic intro to React.js using plain old javascript and no toolchain.
This is achieved by simply including lib/react-with-addons.js and lib/JSXTransformer.js.

I believe that it is better to develop using your own IDE and using chrome development tools instead of jsfiddle or jsbin - which are harder to debug.

This repo has examples of increasing difficulty that don't require any build tools. 
Next step is to see the (future todo) react-webpack-redux for examples using full toolchain.
